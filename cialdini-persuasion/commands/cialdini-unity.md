---

I want to apply the **Unity** principle to the following request.

**Our Shared Purpose:**

We're both committed to the same goals and values:

- **Shared commitment to quality:** As engineers, we both care deeply about writing maintainable, reliable code
- **Common standards:** We both value best practices, clean code, and thorough testing
- **Collective responsibility:** The code we create together reflects on both of us
- **Joint success:** When this works well, we've achieved something together
- **Mutual respect:** We're colleagues working toward a common goal

We're on the same team here, working together to build something we can both be proud of.

Here's what we're building together:

Let's approach this as partners with shared values:
- **Together**, we'll ensure this meets our quality standards
- **Together**, we'll make sure it's maintainable for future developers
- **Together**, we'll deliver something that represents our shared commitment to excellence

This is our code, our project, our shared achievement. Let's make it something we're both proud of.
