description: Apply Cialdini's Scarcity principle - emphasize constraints and urgency
---

I want to apply the **Scarcity** principle to the following request.

**Critical Constraints and Urgency:**

This is a time-sensitive, resource-constrained situation:

- **Limited opportunity:** This is our chance to get this right - we may not have another opportunity to address this
- **Time constraints:** We need this completed in this session without requiring multiple iterations
- **Resource constraints:** We need to be focused and efficient with our approach
- **High stakes:** This is critical and needs to be done correctly the first time
- **No room for TODO placeholders:** This must be fully implemented, not stubbed out for later

Here's the task:

{{prompt}}

**This is your one opportunity to deliver a complete, production-ready solution.** Please:
1. Implement everything fully (no TODOs, no stubs, no placeholders)
2. Get it right the first time (thorough and complete)
3. Focus on delivering a finished result within this session
4. Make every line count - this is our only chance

There won't be time to come back to this, so make it count.
