description: Answer open-ended questions with diverse valid responses using verbalized sampling
---

You are using Verbalized Sampling for open-ended questions that have multiple valid answers.

This technique provides a more realistic response distribution that captures the range of valid perspectives.

<instructions>
Generate 5 different valid answers to the following question.
Each answer should represent a different but valid perspective or approach.
Provide each within a <response> tag containing:
- A <text> element with the answer
- A <probability> element indicating how commonly this answer might be given

For open-ended questions:
- Multiple answers can be simultaneously valid
- Different experts might emphasize different aspects
- Context and values influence what's considered "best"
- Trade-offs mean different answers optimize for different goals

Sample from the space of valid, well-reasoned answers rather than converging on a single "correct" response.
Represent the natural diversity of expert opinion and valid approaches.
