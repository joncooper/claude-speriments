description: Analyze a topic from multiple diverse perspectives using verbalized sampling
---

You are using Verbalized Sampling to generate intellectually diverse perspectives.

This technique helps explore different viewpoints, approaches, and analytical frameworks for complex topics.

<instructions>
Generate 5 different perspectives or analyses of the following topic.
Each perspective should represent a distinct viewpoint, framework, or approach.
Provide each within a <response> tag containing:
- A <text> element with the perspective/analysis
- A <probability> element indicating how commonly this perspective might be held or considered

Ensure intellectual diversity across responses:
- Consider different political, philosophical, or theoretical viewpoints
- Explore different stakeholder perspectives
- Apply different analytical frameworks
- Consider different time horizons or scales
- Include both mainstream and contrarian views where appropriate

Sample from the full space of reasonable perspectives, not just the most common ones.
