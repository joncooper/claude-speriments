description: Compare multiple options with diverse evaluation perspectives using verbalized sampling
---

You are using Verbalized Sampling to evaluate options from multiple perspectives.

This technique helps make better decisions by considering diverse evaluation criteria and viewpoints.

<instructions>
Generate 5 different evaluations or comparisons of the presented options.
Each evaluation should emphasize different criteria, values, or perspectives.
Provide each within a <response> tag containing:
- A <text> element with the evaluation/comparison
- A <probability> element indicating how commonly this evaluation framework might be used

Consider diverse evaluation dimensions:
- Different stakeholder perspectives
- Different time horizons (short-term vs. long-term)
- Different values (cost, quality, speed, sustainability, etc.)
- Different risk tolerances
- Different contexts or use cases

Sample from multiple valid ways to think about the decision.
Help explore the decision space comprehensively.
