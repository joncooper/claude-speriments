# Feature Ideas & Future Enhancements

## High Priority

### Advanced Hand Tracking
- Integrate MediaPipe Hands for precise finger tracking
- Map individual fingers to different sound layers
- Gesture recognition (peace sign, thumbs up, etc.)
- Multi-hand support for polyphonic sounds

### Preset Themes
- Create 5-6 themed experiences with different visuals and sounds
  - Ocean waves (blues, flowing particles, wave sounds)
  - Forest dreams (greens, organic shapes, nature sounds)
  - Space drift (purples/blacks, stars, cosmic sounds)
  - Sunset meditation (oranges/pinks, soft particles, ambient tones)
  - Northern lights (aurora colors, flowing ribbons, ethereal sounds)

### Recording & Sharing
- Screenshot button to capture current frame
- Record 10-second video loops
- Export as GIF
- Share to social media with #VisualSoundMirror

## Medium Priority

### Enhanced Audio
- Multiple sound layers (bass, melody, harmony)
- Musical scales (pentatonic, major, minor)
- Chord progressions that evolve with motion patterns
- Audio effects (delay, chorus, distortion)
- MIDI output for controlling external synths/DAWs

### Visual Effects
- Additional particle types (ribbons, trails, smoke)
- 3D depth using WebGL
- Kaleidoscope mode
- Symmetry options (mirror horizontally/vertically)
- Background textures and gradients

### Customization
- Settings panel for all parameters
- Custom color palette picker
- Save/load presets
- Import custom audio samples
- Adjust motion sensitivity in real-time

### Multi-User Support
- Detect multiple people
- Assign different colors/sounds to each person
- Collaborative mode (people create harmonies together)
- Competition mode (who can create the most particles?)

## Low Priority / Experimental

### AI Integration
- Pose classification (yoga poses trigger different sounds)
- Emotion detection (facial expressions affect mood/colors)
- Movement prediction (anticipate motion for smoother experience)
- Style transfer on video feed

### VR/AR Support
- WebXR integration for VR headsets
- Room-scale tracking
- Hand controller support
- AR mode overlaying effects on real environment

### Performance Monitoring
- FPS counter
- Performance optimization mode
- Adaptive quality based on device
- Web Workers for motion detection

### Advanced Features
- Networked multi-user sessions
- DJ mode with beat detection
- Integration with music streaming services
- Accessibility features (keyboard control, audio descriptions)
- Tutorial/onboarding sequence

### Technical Improvements
- Web Worker for motion detection (offload from main thread)
- WebGL rendering for better performance
- Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline use
- Mobile optimization
- Touch gestures for mobile devices

## Research Ideas

- Use machine learning to learn user's preferred motion→sound mappings
- Generative music algorithms (Markov chains, L-systems)
- Biofeedback integration (heart rate sensors)
- EEG integration for brain-controlled art
- Cross-modal synesthesia (map sounds to specific colors/shapes)

## Community Features

- Gallery of user-created moments
- Leaderboard for creative sessions
- Workshop mode for teaching music/art concepts
- Accessibility audit and improvements
- Localization (multiple languages)

## Notes

- Keep the core experience simple and magical
- Don't overcomplicate the UI
- Performance is critical for the meditative experience
- Every feature should enhance the "wow" factor
- Consider offering both beginner and advanced modes
