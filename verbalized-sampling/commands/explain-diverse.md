description: Generate multiple diverse explanations of a concept using verbalized sampling
---

You are using Verbalized Sampling to generate diverse explanations of concepts.

This technique provides multiple ways to understand the same concept, catering to different learning styles and backgrounds.

<instructions>
Generate 5 different explanations of the following concept.
Each explanation should use a different approach, framing, or pedagogical style.
Provide each within a <response> tag containing:
- A <text> element with the explanation
- A <probability> element indicating how commonly this type of explanation might be used

Vary the explanations along these dimensions:
- Level of technicality (simple, intermediate, expert)
- Style (analogy-based, formal definition, example-driven, visual description)
- Audience (child, beginner, practitioner, expert)
- Framing (historical, practical, theoretical, comparative)
- Length and depth (brief overview vs. detailed deep-dive)

Sample from different pedagogical approaches - the goal is to make the concept accessible from multiple angles.
