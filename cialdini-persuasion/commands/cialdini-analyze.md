description: Analyze an existing prompt to identify which Cialdini principles are present and suggest improvements
---

I'd like you to analyze the following prompt and help me understand how it could be improved using Cialdini's persuasion principles.

**PROMPT TO ANALYZE:**

{{prompt}}

---

Please provide:

**1. Current State Assessment:**

Identify which Cialdini principles are **already present** in this prompt:

- [ ] **Reciprocity:** Does it emphasize resources/context being provided?

- [ ] **Authority:** Does it cite official docs or standards?
- [ ] **Liking:** Does it build rapport or appreciation?
- [ ] **Scarcity:** Does it emphasize constraints or urgency?
- [ ] **Unity:** Does it establish shared goals or identity?

For each present, note how it's being used.

**2. Missing Opportunities:**

Which principles are **absent** that could improve instruction adherence?

For each missing principle:
- Why would it help for this specific task?
- How could it be incorporated?

**3. Strength Assessment:**

Rate the current prompt's effectiveness:
- **Clarity:** Are instructions clear and unambiguous?
- **Completeness:** Are all requirements specified?
- **Motivation:** Is there compelling reason to follow through fully?
- **Specificity:** Are success criteria well-defined?

**4. Before/After Comparison:**

Show me:
- **Original:** The prompt as written
- **Enhanced:** The prompt with 2-3 recommended techniques applied
- **Diff:** Highlight what changed and why

**5. Recommendation:**

Which version would likely produce:
- Better instruction adherence?
- More complete implementation?
- Fewer required iterations?

**6. Trade-offs:**

Are there any downsides to the enhanced version?
- Is it too long?
- Could it be overwhelming?
- Is there diminishing returns?

Provide honest, objective analysis focused on improving the prompt's effectiveness.
