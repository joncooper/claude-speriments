description: Analyze your prompt and suggest which Cialdini techniques would be most effective
---

I have a task I want to give you, but first I need your help optimizing how I phrase it.

Here's my initial request:

{{prompt}}

Please analyze this request and help me apply the most effective persuasion techniques:

**1. Analyze the task type:**
   - What kind of task is this? (multi-step, refactoring, bug fix, new feature, etc.)
   - What are the key challenges or potential failure modes?
   - What does success look like?

**2. Recommend techniques from Cialdini's 7 principles:**

   - **Reciprocity:** Emphasize resources/context I'm providing
   - **Commitment & Consistency:** Get you to commit to a plan, then execute it
   - **Social Proof:** Reference industry best practices and common patterns
   - **Authority:** Cite official documentation and standards
   - **Liking:** Build rapport and collaborative relationship
   - **Scarcity:** Emphasize time/resource constraints and urgency
   - **Unity:** Establish shared goals and identity

**3. Select the top 2-3 techniques** that would most improve instruction adherence for this specific task.

**4. Explain your reasoning:** Why are these techniques most relevant for this particular request?

**5. Show the enhanced prompt:** Demonstrate what the prompt would look like with those techniques applied.

**6. Ask if I'd like you to proceed** with the enhanced version or if I'd like to modify the approach.

Be thoughtful and selective - not every principle fits every situation. Focus on techniques that genuinely address the specific challenges of this task.
