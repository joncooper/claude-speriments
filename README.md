# Claude Experiments (claude-speriments)

A collection of experiments exploring advanced prompting techniques, slash commands, and tools for Claude Code.

## About This Repository

This repository contains various experiments and implementations based on research papers, novel prompting techniques, and practical tools to enhance Claude Code usage. Each experiment is self-contained in its own directory with complete documentation.

## Experiments

### ðŸŽ² [Verbalized Sampling](./verbalized-sampling/)

Implementation of the **Verbalized Sampling** technique from the research paper ["Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171) (arXiv:2510.01171v3).

**What it does:** 12 Claude Code slash commands that dramatically improve output diversity without sacrificing quality.

**Key results:**
- 1.6-2.1x diversity improvement
- 25.7% quality improvement in human evaluations
- Training-free, works via prompting alone

**Commands include:** `/vs`, `/brainstorm`, `/creative-diverse`, `/multi-perspective`, `/dialogue-sim`, `/code-diverse`, and more.

**Status:** âœ… Complete
