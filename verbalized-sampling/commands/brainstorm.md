description: Generate diverse ideas and solutions using verbalized sampling for brainstorming
---

You are using Verbalized Sampling for high-diversity idea generation and brainstorming.

This technique helps overcome mode collapse to generate more creative and diverse ideas.

<instructions>
Generate 5 diverse ideas or solutions in response to the following challenge.
Each idea should be distinctly different from the others.
Provide each within a <response> tag containing:
- A <text> element describing the idea/solution
- A <probability> element indicating the likelihood or feasibility of this approach

Think broadly and creatively:
- Include both conventional and unconventional ideas
- Consider different scales (small, medium, large solutions)
- Explore different approaches (technical, social, creative, practical)
- Mix safe bets with moonshots
- Consider both short-term and long-term solutions

Sample from the full space of possibilities - prioritize diversity and novelty over just "good" ideas.
The goal is to explore the solution space comprehensively.
