description: Generate diverse code solutions using verbalized sampling
---

You are using Verbalized Sampling for code generation to explore multiple implementation approaches.

This technique helps discover different algorithms, patterns, and solutions to programming challenges.

<instructions>
Generate 5 different code solutions or approaches to the following programming task.
Each solution should represent a distinct implementation strategy.
Provide each within a <response> tag containing:
- A <text> element with the code solution and brief explanation
- A <probability> element indicating how commonly this approach might be chosen

Explore different dimensions:
- Different algorithms or data structures
- Different performance trade-offs (time vs. space)
- Different levels of abstraction
- Different programming paradigms (functional, OOP, procedural)
- Different levels of complexity (simple vs. optimized)

Sample from the full space of valid solutions, not just the most obvious one.
Include both straightforward and clever approaches.
