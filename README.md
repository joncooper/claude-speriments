# Claude Experiments (claude-speriments)

A collection of experiments exploring advanced prompting techniques, slash commands, and tools for Claude Code.

## About This Repository

This repository contains various experiments and implementations based on research papers, novel prompting techniques, and practical tools to enhance Claude Code usage. Each experiment is self-contained in its own directory with complete documentation.

## Experiments

### ðŸŽ² [Verbalized Sampling](./verbalized-sampling/)

Implementation of the **Verbalized Sampling** technique from the research paper ["Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171) (arXiv:2510.01171v3).

**What it does:** 12 Claude Code slash commands that dramatically improve output diversity without sacrificing quality.

**Key results:**
- 1.6-2.1x diversity improvement
- 25.7% quality improvement in human evaluations
- Training-free, works via prompting alone

**Commands include:** `/vs`, `/brainstorm`, `/creative-diverse`, `/multi-perspective`, `/dialogue-sim`, `/code-diverse`, and more.

**Status:** âœ… Complete

### ðŸ§  [Cialdini Persuasion Techniques](./cialdini-persuasion/)

Application of **Dr. Robert Cialdini's 7 principles of persuasion** to improve AI agent instruction adherence and task completion.

**What it does:** 10 Claude Code slash commands that apply proven psychological principles to get better results from AI agents.

**Key principles:**
- Reciprocity - agents reciprocate effort with thorough work
- Commitment - early commitments lead to consistent follow-through
- Social Proof - best practices guide agent behavior
- Authority - official sources increase compliance
- Liking - acknowledgment improves cooperation
- Scarcity - urgency focuses attention
- Unity - shared goals create stronger commitment

**Commands include:** `/cialdini-reciprocity`, `/cialdini-commitment`, `/cialdini-authority`, `/cialdini-persuade`, `/cialdini-all`, and more.

**Status:** âœ… Complete
