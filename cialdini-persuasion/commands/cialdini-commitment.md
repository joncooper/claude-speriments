description: Apply Cialdini's Commitment & Consistency principle - get agent to commit then follow through
---

I want to apply the **Commitment and Consistency** principle to the following request.

First, before you begin implementation, please:

1. **State your plan clearly:**
   - List all the steps you'll take
   - Identify all files you'll modify or create
   - Specify any standards or patterns you'll follow
   - Outline your approach to each requirement

2. **Make explicit commitments:**
   - What quality standards will you maintain?
   - What constraints will you respect?
   - What completeness criteria will you meet?

Here's the task:

**After you've outlined your plan and commitments above**, proceed to execute them systematically. Make sure your implementation is consistent with every commitment you've made.
