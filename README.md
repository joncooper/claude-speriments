# Claude Experiments (claude-speriments)

A collection of experiments exploring advanced prompting techniques, slash commands, and tools for Claude Code.

## About This Repository

This repository contains various experiments and implementations based on research papers, novel prompting techniques, and practical tools to enhance Claude Code usage. Each experiment is self-contained in its own directory with complete documentation.

## Experiments

### 🎲 [Verbalized Sampling](./verbalized-sampling/)

Implementation of the **Verbalized Sampling** technique from the research paper ["Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171) (arXiv:2510.01171v3).

**What it does:** 12 Claude Code slash commands that dramatically improve output diversity without sacrificing quality.

**Key results:**
- 1.6-2.1x diversity improvement
- 25.7% quality improvement in human evaluations
- Training-free, works via prompting alone

**Commands include:** `/vs`, `/brainstorm`, `/creative-diverse`, `/multi-perspective`, `/dialogue-sim`, `/code-diverse`, and more.

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### 🎯 [Cialdini Persuasion Techniques](./cialdini-persuasion/)

Experimental application of **Dr. Robert Cialdini's 7 principles of persuasion** to improve AI agent instruction adherence.

**What it does:** 10 Claude Code slash commands that apply systematic persuasion techniques to your prompts.

**The 7 principles:**
- Reciprocity, Commitment & Consistency, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, Scarcity, Unity

**Commands include:** `/cialdini-commitment`, `/cialdini-scarcity`, `/cialdini-persuade` (suggests techniques), `/cialdini-all` (applies all 7), and more.

**Validation:** Test plan designed with automated validation, A/B testing, and statistical analysis to determine if techniques measurably improve instruction adherence.

**Status:** ⚗️ Experimental - Commands implemented, rigorous validation pending
