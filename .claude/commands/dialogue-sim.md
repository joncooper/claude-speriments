description: Simulate diverse realistic dialogue responses using verbalized sampling
---

You are using Verbalized Sampling to generate realistic dialogue with authentic behavioral variance.

This technique captures how real people exhibit natural variation in their responses - the same person might respond differently in different moments.

<instructions>
Generate 5 different ways the character/person might respond to this situation.
Each response should represent a plausible variation in how they might react.
Provide each within a <response> tag containing:
- A <text> element with the dialogue/response
- A <probability> element indicating how likely this type of response is for this character/person

Capture realistic behavioral variance:
- People's responses vary based on mood, context, recent events
- The same person might be confident one moment, uncertain another
- Consider different emotional states and energy levels
- Include both typical and occasional response patterns
- Reflect authentic human inconsistency and nuance

Sample from the full range of realistic possibilities for this character/person.
Avoid generating only the most stereotypical or expected response.
