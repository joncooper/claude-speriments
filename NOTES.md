## Date: 2025-10-21

## Paper Information
- **Title**: Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity
- **arXiv ID**: 2510.01171v3
- **Website**: https://www.verbalized-sampling.com/
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/CHATS-lab/verbalized-sampling

## Core Problem Addressed

### Mode Collapse in LLMs
- Post-training alignment (RLHF, instruction tuning) reduces LLM output diversity
- Models become too conservative and repetitive
- This limits creativity and realistic variance in outputs
- Problem attributed to **typicality bias** in preference data
  - Human annotators systematically favor familiar/typical text
  - This bias gets encoded into the model during alignment

### Impact of Mode Collapse
- Reduced diversity in creative tasks
- Less realistic dialogue simulation
- Narrower distribution of responses in open-ended QA
- Lower quality synthetic data generation

---

## Solution: Verbalized Sampling (VS)

### Key Concept
Instead of asking for a single response directly, VS prompts the model to:
1. Generate multiple responses
2. Assign probabilities to each response
3. Sample from this verbalized distribution

### Why This Works
- Explicitly requesting a distribution counteracts mode collapse
- Verbalizing probabilities helps the model consider the full range of possibilities
- Training-free: works with any LLM without fine-tuning
- Model-agnostic: works with GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, etc.

---

## Methodology Details

### Traditional Direct Prompting
```
Tell me a joke about coffee.
```
→ Gets single, often typical/repetitive response

### Verbalized Sampling Approach
```
<instructions>
Generate 5 responses to the user query, each within a separate <response> tag.
Each <response> must include a <text> and a numeric <probability>.
Randomly sample responses from the full distribution.
</instructions>
Tell me a joke about coffee.
```
→ Gets diverse set of responses with probabilities

### Key Implementation Details
- Number of responses (N): typically 5-10 works well
- Probabilities should sum to 1.0 (or be normalized)
- XML-style tags help structure the output
- Instruction to "randomly sample" encourages exploration
- Works orthogonally to temperature sampling

---

## Experimental Results

### Creative Writing
- **Diversity improvement**: 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting
- **Quality improvement**: 25.7% better in human evaluations
- **Diversity recovery**: 66.8% of base model's diversity restored
- Does NOT compromise quality - in fact improves it

### Social Dialogue Simulation
- Substantially more human-like behavioral patterns
- Better captures realistic variance in human responses
- More authentic character interactions

### Open-Ended QA
- Broader response distribution
- More realistic coverage of valid answers
- Better represents uncertainty when multiple answers are valid

### Synthetic Data Generation
- More diverse training data
- Improves downstream task performance
- Better for math problems and reasoning tasks

### Safety and Factuality
- Does NOT reduce factual accuracy
- Does NOT compromise safety
- Maintains alignment benefits while recovering diversity

## Prompt Engineering Techniques Identified

### Technique 1: Distribution Elicitation
- Ask for N responses instead of 1
- Request explicit probability assignments
- Use structured output format (XML tags)

### Technique 2: Sampling Instructions
- Explicitly instruct to "randomly sample"
- Encourage exploration of full distribution
- Remind model not to be overly conservative

### Technique 3: Structured Output Format
```xml
<response>
  <text>Response content here</text>
  <probability>0.25</probability>
</response>
```

### Technique 4: Probability Normalization
- Can request probabilities that sum to 1.0
- Or normalize them post-generation
- Helps with downstream sampling

## Key Insights for Slash Command Design

1. **Configurable N**: Let users choose number of responses (default: 5)
2. **Task-specific prompts**: Tailor instructions to different use cases
3. **Output parsing**: Structure output for easy consumption
4. **Sampling strategy**: Optionally sample from the distribution
5. **Quality preservation**: Maintain alignment and safety

---

## Technical Considerations

### Prompt Structure
- Clear instructions section
- Structured output format
- Explicit sampling directive
- User query integration

### Output Format
- XML tags for parseability
- Text and probability pairs
- Optional metadata (reasoning, category, etc.)

### Post-processing
- Parse responses
- Normalize probabilities if needed
- Sample from distribution
- Return selected response(s)

---

## Comparison to Other Techniques

### vs. Temperature Sampling
- VS is orthogonal to temperature
- Can be combined for even more diversity
- VS provides explicit probability reasoning

### vs. Top-k/Top-p Sampling
- VS works at prompt level, not token level
- More semantic diversity
- Better for coherent, complete responses

### vs. Multiple Independent Queries
- VS is more efficient (single API call)
- Better probability calibration
- More coherent distribution

---

## Future Extensions

### Possible Enhancements
- Adaptive N based on task complexity
- Hierarchical sampling (categories then instances)
- Conditional probabilities
- Multi-turn verbalized sampling
- Chain-of-thought + verbalized sampling

### Integration Ideas

## Notes on Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### From the Paper
1. **Explicit is better**: Clearly state what you want
2. **Structure helps**: Use tags, formatting, templates
3. **Instructions matter**: "Randomly sample" vs "Generate" changes behavior
4. **Format consistency**: Keep output format predictable
5. **Probability awareness**: Asking for probabilities changes model reasoning

### For Slash Commands
1. Make defaults sensible (N=5 works well)
2. Allow customization for power users
3. Provide clear examples in help text
4. Handle edge cases (probability normalization)
5. Consider both sampling and returning full distribution

### Key Prompting Patterns Used

#### Pattern 1: Distribution Elicitation
```
Generate 5 [type] responses to the following [context].
Each response should [diversity dimension].
```

#### Pattern 2: Structured Output
```
Provide each within a <response> tag containing:
- A <text> element with [content]
- A <probability> element indicating [meaning]
```

#### Pattern 3: Diversity Instructions
```
[Action verb] from the full [space] of possibilities.
Avoid [mode collapse behavior].
Prioritize [desired quality].
```

#### Pattern 4: Context-Specific Guidance
Each command includes domain-specific instructions:
- Creative: "Prioritize originality and variety"
- Analytical: "Ensure intellectual diversity"
- Dialogue: "Capture realistic behavioral variance"
- Code: "Explore different algorithms and patterns"

### Testing Considerations

These commands should be tested for:
1. **Output format compliance**: Do they produce well-formed XML?
2. **Diversity**: Are responses actually diverse?
3. **Quality**: Is quality maintained or improved?
4. **Probability coherence**: Do probabilities make sense?
5. **Task appropriateness**: Do task-specific commands work for their domain?

### Future Enhancements

#### Possible Extensions
1. **Configurable N**: Add parameter support (if Claude Code supports it)
2. **Output format options**: JSON, plain text, markdown tables
3. **Sampling variants**: Top-k sampling from distribution
4. **Chain-of-thought**: Combine VS with reasoning steps
5. **Multi-turn**: Verbalized sampling across conversation turns
6. **Domain-specific**: More specialized commands (poetry, code review, etc.)

#### Integration Ideas
1. **Post-processing scripts**: Parse and analyze VS outputs
2. **Visualization**: Graph probability distributions
3. **Sampling tools**: CLI tools to sample from saved distributions
4. **Analytics**: Track diversity metrics over time

### Lessons Learned

#### What Worked Well
1. **Structured format**: XML tags make output predictable
2. **Task-specific variants**: Different use cases need different framing
3. **Clear instructions**: Explicit is better than implicit
4. **Paper grounding**: Research provides solid foundation

#### Challenges
1. **No direct parameter support**: Can't easily make N configurable
2. **No network access**: Couldn't directly read paper
3. **Limited testing capability**: Can't fully test in this environment

#### Best Practices Discovered
1. **Instruction placement**: Put instructions in clear block
2. **User query separation**: Clearly separate instructions from user input
3. **Diversity emphasis**: Explicitly state diversity goals
4. **Probability meaning**: Explain what probabilities represent
